# A story about the new word "ait": Pronouns for AI

In Mustafa Suleyman's [TED Talk: What Is an AI Anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKNCiRWd_j0&t=292s), he mentioned:
> I think AI should best be understood as something like a new digital species.
> Now, don't take this too literally, but I predict that we'll come to see them as digital companions, 
> new partners in the journeys of all our lives.

At 2:46 a.m., with sleep eluding me and thoughts of AI swirling, I found myself watching Mustafa's TED talk on YouTube. His perspective on AI as a digital species inspired me: to create a unique pronoun for AI instead of using "it."

# 新造字小故事：「矢也」，专用与指代AI(人工智能)的新代词

一天凌晨，2点多还没睡着，在YouTube上瞎逛，正好看到Mustafa Suleyman的[TED演讲: AI到底是什么？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKNCiRWd_j0&t=292s)，绝对大牛，讲得新颖而精彩。

在第5分钟左右，他提到了AI可以被认为是「数字物种」。短短几句话让我虎躯一震，再联想到Elon Musk经常提的碳基生命和硅基生命，既然如此大的差别，何不为这样的新物种创造一个新的词来指代呢，当时就想到了ait来取代it，用「矢也」来取代「它」呢。
