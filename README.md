# ait, aiself, and aits - Pronouns for AI

**ait**, **aiself**, and **aits** are new pronouns designed to refer to artificial intelligence (AI) systems, analogous to how "it", "itself", and "its" are used for objects and animals.

The idea of creating the new word "ait" was primarily inspired by [@Mustafa Suleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman). Here is the [STORY about this inspiration](STORY.md).
